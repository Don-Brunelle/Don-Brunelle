Designing a state diagram for traffic lights at an intersection in Gishushu, Kigali, specifically at the Remera area, involves modeling the behavior of the traffic light system as a finite state machine (FSM). A state diagram will describe the different states of the traffic lights and how they transition from one state to another based on the timing or sensor inputs.

Assumptions:
The intersection has standard traffic lights (Red, Yellow, Green) for multiple directions (e.g., North-South, East-West).
The lights follow a fixed-time or sensor-based sequence.
Traffic light phases (green, yellow, red) cycle to control traffic flow in different directions.
Components of the State Diagram:
States:

Red (R): The light is red, meaning vehicles must stop.
Yellow (Y): The light is yellow, indicating caution before changing to red or green.
Green (G): The light is green, allowing traffic to proceed.
There may be states for different directions at the intersection:

NS-G (North-South Green): Green for the North-South direction, red for East-West.
NS-Y (North-South Yellow): Yellow for the North-South direction, red for East-West.
EW-G (East-West Green): Green for the East-West direction, red for North-South.
EW-Y (East-West Yellow): Yellow for the East-West direction, red for North-South.
Transitions:

Transitions between these states depend on timers (i.e., fixed green, yellow, and red durations) or sensors (for detecting cars waiting at intersections).
A state transition can also be initiated by a timer expiring or sensor activation.
Timing:

Each light will typically stay in a green state for a fixed duration (e.g., 30 seconds).
Yellow typically lasts for 3 to 5 seconds before switching to red.
Red lasts for a fixed time or until sensors detect traffic.

Explanation of the State Diagram:
Initial State: NS-G (North-South Green):

The traffic light for North-South is green, and the East-West light is red.
After a certain period, the system transitions to the next state: NS-Y (North-South Yellow).
NS-Y (North-South Yellow):

After the North-South green phase, the light turns yellow, indicating it will soon turn red.
After the yellow light expires, the system transitions to EW-G (East-West Green).
EW-G (East-West Green):

In this state, traffic from the East-West direction is allowed to go, and the North-South direction has a red light.
After a set duration, the system transitions to EW-Y (East-West Yellow).
EW-Y (East-West Yellow):

This state serves as a transition from green to red for the East-West direction.
After this period, the system returns to NS-G, starting the cycle again for North-South direction.
Optional Additions:
Pedestrian Crosswalks: You may also want to model pedestrian signals, where specific lights will show a "Walk" or "Don't Walk" signal depending on the current state.
Sensor-based Transitions: If the intersection is smart or sensor-controlled, you can have additional transitions based on vehicle or pedestrian detection, shortening or extending green phases.
Timing Considerations:
Green Light Duration: Typically around 30 seconds, but can vary based on traffic flow.
Yellow Light Duration: Usually between 3 to 5 seconds.
Red Light Duration: Can be fixed or dependent on sensors detecting waiting vehicles
